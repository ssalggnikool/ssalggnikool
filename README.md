### `インターネットを使うのをやめろ`

## Skills

- Swift
- Objective-C
- C
- HTML/CSS/JS

I mainly use **Cocoa** frameworks for my iOS projects, though sometimes I do also incorporate **SwiftUI** in some very specific cases. 

For web it's just the standard **HTML/CSS/JS**, with the Astro framework.

I often do requests for people I'm close with regarding UI/UX stuff, sometimes some of that don't hit the light of day but thats fine.
